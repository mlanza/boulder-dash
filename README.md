# Boulder Dash

Demo building a real-time 2D game using [Atomic](https://github.com/mlanza/atomic) and a simple ECS.  [Boulder Dash](https://boulder-dash.com/online-free-game/) is a classic from my childhood.

I've had a longtime fascination with [Entity Component Systems](Entity_component_system) and this felt a good opportunity to scratch that itch.  Although the concept came about to facilitate better performance, I wanted to model mine as a simulation using persistent data structures to see how well it might fit the functional paradigm.

As usual my early commits especially are experimental, figuring out how best to proceed.
